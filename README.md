# CrabGameUnstableRocksGameMode
A BepInEx mod for Crab Game that adds a TNT Run (Minecraft) or Hex-A-Gon (Fall Guys) like game mode.

Depends on [CustomGameModes](https://github.com/lammas321/CrabGameCustomGameModes/)

- The rocks are unstable and will break shortly after being stood on
- Stay on your toes and keep moving, but not too fast!

## Why aren't there multiple layers?
Because that isn't possible to do in a way that is vanilla compatible.
